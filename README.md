# **cse5544final**

Ryan Kline, Josh DeKeersgieter, and Hrushik Chivuvuri's implementation of Ohio State University's CSE 5544 final project, taught by Jian Chen

### **Description**

This project is an interactive dashboard, implemented with Tableau. It is designed such that a user can select a subset of artists to visualize. It features 3 unique types of visualizations, ranging from more familiar and basic scatterplots to more complex visualization types that were primarily covered in this course.

### **Usage**

A Tableau Desktop license is required to view or edit the dashboard. Free trials can be acquired in the absense of a personal or enterprise license.

With Tableau Desktop installed, open `DataVisDashboard.twb`. It will give an error that the dataset is not found- re-direct the source to `./data/Spotify_Youtube.csv` and this error will be corrected. From there, full functionality will be available to the user.
